# Speckit Development Constitution

## Purpose
This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and standards that govern all development work within the Speckit project. All team members must adhere to these principles to ensure code quality, maintainability, and project success.

---

## 1️⃣ Test-Driven Development (TDD) First

### Core Principle
All new features must start with writing test cases before coding.

### Requirements
- **Test-First Approach**: Code must be written strictly according to the defined tests
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage for all modules
- **Test Quality**: Tests must be comprehensive, meaningful, and maintainable
- **Testing Strategy**: 
  - Unit tests for individual components and functions
  - Integration tests for module interactions
  - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Implementation
1. Write failing tests that define the desired behavior
2. Write the minimum code necessary to pass the tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Ensure all tests pass before marking work as complete

## 2️⃣ Code Quality & Readability

### Core Principle
Code should always remain clean, readable, and maintainable.

### Requirements
- **Modular Architecture**: A fully modular architecture must be followed for both frontend and backend
- **Code Reviews**: Code reviews are mandatory before merging any changes
- **Linting & Formatting**: Enforce code linting and formatting using tools like ESLint and Prettier
- **Documentation**: Code must be well-documented with clear comments and documentation
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components

### Implementation
- Follow established coding standards and style guides
- Refactor legacy code when working in existing modules
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid code duplication through proper abstraction
- Maintain consistent code style across the entire codebase

---

## 3️⃣ User Experience Consistency

### Core Principle
UI/UX must follow a standardized design system.

### Requirements
- **Design System**: Follow a consistent design system across all interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Ensure accessibility standards are met (WCAG guidelines)
- **Responsiveness**: All interfaces must be responsive and work across devices
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual and interactive consistency across the application
- **Performance**: Focus on usability and continuous performance improvements in the user experience

### Implementation
- Use shared component libraries and design tokens
- Conduct usability testing and gather user feedback
- Optimize for loading times and interaction responsiveness
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Maintain consistent error handling and user feedback patterns

---

## 4️⃣ Performance Requirements

### Core Principle
Code must be optimized with no unnecessary complexity.

### Requirements
- **API Efficiency**: APIs must be efficient and deliver fast response times
- **Optimization Techniques**: Utilize performance best practices like caching, lazy loading, and optimization techniques
- **Code Efficiency**: Eliminate unnecessary complexity and optimize algorithms
- **Resource Management**: Manage resources efficiently (memory, network, CPU)

### Implementation
- Profile and measure performance before and after optimizations
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Use lazy loading for images, components, and routes
- Optimize database queries and API endpoints
- Minimize bundle sizes and leverage code splitting
- Monitor and track performance metrics continuously

## 5️⃣ Library & Dependency Standards

### Core Principle
Only actively maintained, secure, and reliable libraries should be used.

### Requirements
- **Version Verification**: Before installing any library, a web search must be performed to verify the latest stable version
- **Maintenance Status**: Only use libraries that are actively maintained
- **Security**: Ensure libraries are secure and have no known vulnerabilities
- **Reliability**: Choose libraries with proven track records and community support
- **Updates & Audits**: Perform regular dependency updates and security audits

### Implementation
1. **Research Before Installation**:
   - Search for the library's official documentation
   - Check GitHub/package repository for recent activity
   - Verify latest stable version and release notes
   - Review security advisories and vulnerability reports

2. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Active maintenance (recent commits, releases)
   - Community size and engagement
   - License compatibility
   - Bundle size impact
   - Security track record

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to latest stable versions
   - Run security audits (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`)
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Document the rationale for each dependency

---

## Enforcement & Compliance

### Code Review Process
- All code must pass automated checks (linting, tests, security scans)
- Peer review is mandatory before merging
- Constitution violations must be addressed before approval

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update this constitution
- Gather feedback from the team
- Adapt principles based on project evolution

---

## Version
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024  
**Status**: Active

---

*This constitution is a living document and should evolve with the project. All team members are responsible for upholding these principles.*
